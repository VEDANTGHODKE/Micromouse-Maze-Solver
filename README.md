# Micromouse-Maze-Solver
This is a repository of a Micromouse Maze-Solver project that aims to solve a 30 year old problem which has an unparalleled importance in the field of robotics with complete analysis and implementation of various decision making algorithms. The algorithms are implemented to accurately solve a given maze in the shortest time possible with some robotic intelligence. This project aims towards development of the “Brain of the System”, particularly for robots concerned with path planning and navigation. Path planning to plan its actions including collision-free movement and searching the maze are the two most important aspects in maze solving which were implemented on simulation softwares.

The main goal of the project is to implement and analyze various algorithms for fast and reliable maze solving.
